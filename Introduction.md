# Introduction to GPU
- The Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) is a processor that was specialized for processing graphics.
- The GPU has recently evolved towards a more flexible architecture.
- Opportunity: We can implement *any algorithm*, not only graphics.
- Challenge: obtain efficiency and high performance.
